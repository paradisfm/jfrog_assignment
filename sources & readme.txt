Below is the list of sources I used to complete this assignment.

As a general rule, if it is Artifactory documentation on the internet, I have read it. If it is a YouTube tutorial about JFrog, Artifactory, or REST APIs, I have watched it. If it is a question about Artifactory on Stack Overflow, I have asked it, too.

This began as a Python project, then was a Bash project when I didn't understand how to connect to Artifactory on Python, then Bash became too difficult given that I was unable to both find and interpret online resources on how to use curl commands and Bash syntax in conjunction with Artifactory. I return to Python because I am more comfortable with it, and I know that I can make a working script in Python; I am unsure if I could say the same at this point for Bash. I am a toddler in the deep end. 

I had to make a choice: I could either complete the assignment the way I was asked to, but ultimately submit code that looked like a 6-year-old wrote it. Or, alternatively, I could submit something I know works and am not ashamed to put my name on, but is not exactly in line with the assignment. I apologize, there is one and only one HTTP verb in this assignment. 

I submit this code knowing I gave it my all -- my entire weekend I spent in my office, trying to find better sources to improve my code, trying to absorb every iota of information I found related to the topic at hand.

I chose to implement the following APIs - system ping, create user, delete user, create repository, and list repositories. This is because the documentation for these APIs were much more easily accessible online than others. I had attempted to implement, at some point, every one of the APIs listed in the assignment. This is what I present.

This CLI can be used by simply running the code, or "python main.py cur_command" in terminal. The commands are as follows:

"ping"
"create user"
"delete user"
"create repo"
"list repos"

Thank you for your consideration.
